      "Split tunneling is an option that allows you to have a specific part of your internet connection to be rerouted outside of the VPN. You may find it useful for situations where a VPN connection may be unnecessary, for instance, when dealing with a trusted application.   NordVPN split tunneling is currently available on Windows 7 and 8.1, Windows 10 and 11, Android, and Android TV.  On Windows 7 & 8.1:   Open the settings menu.   Head down to the Split tunneling section, turn it ON, and then press Add apps.     On Windows 10 & 11:   Click on a gear icon in the left-bottom corner.  Choose Split Tunneling settings.  Turn the feature on and choose to add apps.Experiencing issues?Look here, and you'll find the latest updates concerning known issues and how to resolve them.At the moment, it is known that when the split tunneling feature is used, some services still appear to be affected by the VPN. This is related to the fact that although your real IP address does get routed through the excluded application, the DNS servers provided by NordVPN are still in effect, which may cause an issue. We are currently working to resolve this problem.   On Android:  Tap on the profile icon and open the settings menu by tapping on the gear icon.  Head over to the VPN connection settings and choose the Split tunneling option.    On Android TV:​​​​   After you open the NordVPN app, scroll down to the Settings section and click on Trusted apps.  Click on Add apps.  \n",

      "If you’re unable to connect to NordVPN through Chrome, Edge, or Firefox browser extensions, follow these tips to fix the issue:    Don’t connect more than ten devices to one NordVPN account. NordVPN allows you to establish ten simultaneous connections. If you’re past this number, the browser extension won’t allow you to connect. To solve this issue, disconnect from the VPN on one of your devices (or all devices in one go by changing your password). Afterward, manually connect up to ten devices of your choice.   Make sure to turn off other VPN service extensions or apps. Other extensions may interfere with the proxy settings necessary for the NordVPN extension to work.    Wait a little longer to establish a connection. If you’ve closed the VPN browser extension while you were connected to a VPN server, it may take longer to connect the next time you use it.    Refresh the extension by turning it off and on.   Clear your browser cache and delete cookies. Removing old data or resetting the settings may help solve your connection problems.  Make sure you are using the latest browser extension version.   Restart your computer.   Reinstall the browser extension. \n",

Here’s what may help fix the problem.  Operating system-specific NordVPN connection guides  If you are experiencing issues connecting on any of the operating systems below, try following these VPN troubleshooting guides:  Troubleshooting connectivity on Windows Troubleshooting connectivity on Android Troubleshooting connectivity on iOS Troubleshooting connectivity of Linux app Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS  General NordVPN connection tips These tips may help if your NordVPN server is down or if NordVPN is stuck on “connecting”:  If you can’t connect to a specific server, try a few different NordVPN servers. You can use the auto-connect feature or the NordVPN server locator tool to find the right server for you.   Follow the steps below to find the best server for your connection:  Log into your Nord Account, and click NordVPN.  Scroll down to Advanced Settings and click Set up NordVPN manually.  Select the Server recommendation tab. According to your location, the best server will be recommended.  By pressing Advanced filters you can further customize the recommended servers by selecting the Server type and the Security protocol.    On the NordVPN app, log out of your account and log back in. Try connecting again.  Uninstall the app, reboot your device, and install the app again. Try connecting to a server now. Try using a different connection method/protocol for your device.  Is NordVPN down? When a NordVPN server is down, it’s removed from the app’s server list. All NordVPN servers you see on the app should be online.  If you can’t connect to a server and the solutions above don’t work, your device or network may be causing the problem. To check if that’s the case, try using NordVPN on a different device on the same network.  For example, if NordVPN doesn’t work on your Android phone, try using it on your PC. If both devices don’t connect, you may be experiencing network issues. If your PC connects successfully, you may need to reconfigure your phone.  Connecting from a country with internet restrictions If you can’t connect from a country with internet restrictions, you may find a solution in this article:    Connecting from a country with internet restrictions.  \n",

The Quick connect feature provides you with peace of mind by automatically searching for a server that adheres to both of the qualities described above.  Manual connection  Similarly, open and log into the NordVPN app first. Find and click on \"United Kingdom\" within the country list. Again, wait for the connection to be established.   You will now be connected to the closest VPN server with less traffic on. Enjoy the stability and the high speed! The main difference between these two methods is that Quick Connection does not allow you to specify the country, the state or the city that you'll be connecting to.    What qualities make a VPN server the best one for you? In most standard cases, it's the high speed and the reliability of the VPN connection. To achieve both, the best practice is to connect to a VPN server that is closest to your actual location and is less loaded with traffic.

      "Title: What is a proxy server?\n",
      "In computer networks, a proxy server acts as an intermediary for queries from internet users seeking resources from other servers. User joins the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a webpage, connection, file or other resources available from other servers and the proxy server estimates the request as a way to control and simplify it’s complexity. Nowadays, most proxy servers facilitate access to the content on the World Wide Web (WWW). Uses A proxy server has plenty of potential purposes including:  Keep machines anonymous for security; Speed up access to internet content using caching. Web proxies are mostly used to cache web pages from a web server; Block the attempt to download the same content multiple times in order to save bandwidth; Log and audit Internet usage; Scan transferred data for malware before delivery; Scan upload data in order to prevent data loss; Bypass webpage restrictions at work; Access restriction/enhancement; Apply access policy to network content or services; Access websites filtered or banned by your ISP or government; Bypass parental and security controls; Allow the website to make requests to externally hosted resources such as music files, images, movie files, etc. when cross-domain restrictions block the website from connecting directly to the outside domains; Allow browsers to make network requests to externally hosted content in the name of a website when cross-domain restrictions block the browser from directly accessing the outside domains.  Types of proxy  A proxy server may operate on the user’s local computer or at various points between destination servers on the Internet and user’s computer; A proxy server which passes responses and requests unmodified is usually called a tunneling proxy or a gateway; A forward proxy is an Internet-facing proxy which retrieves from a large range of sources, mostly everywhere on the Internet; A reverse proxy usually is an Internet-facing proxy that is used as a front-end to protect and control access to a server on a private network, mostly performing tasks such as caching, authentication, load-balancing, or decryption.

      "In September 2020, NordVPN started the server colocation process and already has 580 colocated servers in 19 different locations. All 5472 servers in 60 countries will become colocated in the future. This change is essential as an additional step to improve the overall service quality for you as a user.  What does server colocation mean? Server colocation is the process of housing servers in a purpose-built data center that allows managing servers by the company itself. This means that from now on, our colocated servers are owned by NordVPN. With the help of the company's partners, servers are now supported by a constant power supply, steady internet connection, protection against natural disasters, and, most importantly, tight security.\n",

      " Can my internet service provider (ISP) track me down if I’m using NordVPN? Does NordVPN hide all online traffic from ISPs? These questions are commonly asked by people weighing their cybersecurity and online privacy options. In this article, we will explore what your ISP can see with NordVPN. Can my ISP see that I’m using NordVPN? When you connect to a NordVPN server, your ISP can see that you’re connected to an IP owned by a VPN service. It might also know the time of your connection and the port your VPN protocol is using. Plus, the provider will see the amount of traffic traveling to and from your device. What does NordVPN hide from my ISP? In essence, your service provider only knows that your actual online traffic is hidden from them. That means it loses access to the following information:  The websites you visit The specific web pages you browse and the time you spend there Your browsing and search history The files you download from or upload to unencrypted websites The info you type on unencrypted websites  Why does the ISP still see some information? Your ISP still sees some information because your service provider connects you to the websites you want to visit. You send it a data package, which works as a request, and the ISP sends it to the correct destination. When you connect to NordVPN, you tell it to send that request to the VPN server. But from that point on, the VPN server takes over the package, and the ISP will never know its final destination. To sum up, the ISP sees the following information when you use NordVPN:  The IP address of the VPN server The timestamp of when you connected The port your VPN protocol is using The amount of data you’re sending or receiving Encrypted and unreadable data traveling between you and the VPN server  So use a VPN to block ISP tracking and protect your privacy\n",
